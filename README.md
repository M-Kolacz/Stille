# Stille 🐦

Stille is a platform where I document my journey in IT. It serves as a space to share my experiences, insights, and projects while reflecting on my growth in the field. The technology stack draws inspiration from the [Epic Stack](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack), developed by [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) and his [incredible community](<(https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/graphs/contributors)>). As the project is still in its early stages, you can expect regular updates and new content.
